## Welcome to Sylvia's Feather
Sylvia's Feather is a big Indie game about a small half avarian half human boy named Palla. He seeks to gain the approval of his harpy friends. When in the temple he finds a mysterious person in with him, he had something but Palla couldn't make it out. The shine was what drew him in, and once the man notices he has been detected he runs. Palla chases him and ends up in an entirely new place. It is up to Palla to retrieve this stolen item and finally be accepted in the eyes of the harpies.
